# Do-Left-handed-People-Really-Die-Young-
Use pandas and Bayesian statistics to see if left-handed people actually die earlier than righties.

explore the phenomenon using age distribution data to see if we can reproduce a difference in average age at death purely from the changing rates of left-handedness over time, refuting the claim of early death for left-handers. This notebook uses pandas and Bayesian statistics to analyze the probability of being a certain age at death given that you are reported as left-handed or right-handed.
